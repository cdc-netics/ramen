# Modules Directory

This directory contains uploaded Node.js modules that are managed by the Module Manager.

Each module gets its own isolated directory with:
- Source files
- package.json
- node_modules (dependencies)
- .env file (environment variables)

Modules in this directory are ignored by git (see .gitignore).
This file ensures the directory structure is maintained in the repository.
